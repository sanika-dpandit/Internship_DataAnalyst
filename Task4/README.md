# Task 4: SQL Queries & Index Optimization

## Objective
Perform SQL-based data extraction and optimization using indexes. The goal is to analyze customer, product, and order data while applying indexing for improved query performance.

## Tools Used
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Sample E-commerce Dataset (ecommerce_demo)
- SQL Workbench / MySQL CLI

## Key Tasks
- Created and used `ecommerce_demo` database
- Wrote queries to join and extract data from multiple tables
- Applied filters, sorting, and aggregations
- Created indexes on frequently queried fields

## SQL Features Demonstrated
- `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- `CREATE INDEX`, `SHOW INDEX`
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`
- Table relationships: Customers, Orders, Products

## Example Queries
- List of customers from Dubai
- Orders with customer and product names
- Total spent by each customer
- Most popular products (by quantity ordered)
- Monthly revenue trend
- Index creation on `customer_id` for optimized joins

## Outcome
- Gained hands-on experience with relational queries and optimization
- Understood how indexing can boost performance for large datasets
- Practiced writing real-world SQL queries for e-commerce analytics
